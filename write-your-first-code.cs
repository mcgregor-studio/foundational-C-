// C# enforces data types and punctuation (like PHP), so remember to use the proper quotes, brackets, and colons

// WriteLine Adds a return after the string, Write does not
// Single quotes for single character, double quotes for strings
Console.WriteLine("Congratulations!");
Console.Write("You just wrote your first line of C#.");
Console.Write('b');

// Use \ for escaping a doublequote in a string so it will show up in the final written line
// Use \\ for escaping a backslash
// Use @ for a string literal (ie. it will keep all whitespace and characters without the need to escape the backslash)
// C# also supports Unicode characters, but some are UTF-16 and some are UTF-32 (meaning they require a different escape sequence), so be careful when using them!
//Example below:

// For math equations that involve decimals and division, the quotient (left of the assignment operator) must be of type decimal and at least one of numbers being divided must also be of type decimal (both numbers can also be a decimal type).

// The following operators work the same as they do in JavaScript (+, -, *, /, %, +=, -=);
// For ++ & --, the position they have influences how they update the variable that they're attached to

// Likewise, value++ will increment the value after the value has been retrieved

// Variables can declared by the type of data that they store first to enforce it
// However, you can still use 'var' so that the computer implies (ie. figures out) the data type on its own
// This also means that a variable declared as 'var' will never be able to hold a different type once the computer implies the data type for the first time
var firstName = "Bob";

//String concatenation - combining strings together into a single literal by attaching them together

//String interpolation - combines multiple different values into a single literal

// Ideally for both, you want to avoid making intermediate variables to combine them and then use them
// You can also do basic calculations in the curly braces, but this is not recommended
// You can also combine interpolation with string literals (@)
// This lets you use newlines and tabs in a writeline methods without using the shorthands (ie. \n, \t)
